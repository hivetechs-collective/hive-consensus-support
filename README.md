## About Hive Consensus

Hive Consensus is a commercial AI-powered IDE featuring:

### üß† Advanced Consensus System

**4-model collaborative intelligence:**
- **3 Discussion Models** analyze and debate your query
- **1 Curator Model** synthesizes the final answer

**Decision Logic:**
- **Majority (2 agree):** Consensus opinion ‚Üí Curator polishes the response
- **Full Consensus (all 3 agree):** United response ‚Üí Curator delivers polished answer
- **Disagreement (all differ):** Curator arbitrates, selecting best from 3 responses + curator's own analysis

This multi-model validation dramatically reduces AI hallucinations through collaborative reasoning.

### ü§ñ 8 Integrated AI Tools

- Claude Code
- Gemini CLI
- OpenAI Codex
- Grok
- Qwen Code
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- Cursor CLI
- GitHub Spec Kit

### üåê 500+ Models from 60+ Providers

Access the entire OpenRouter ecosystem through a unified consensus interface.

### üß† Universal Memory System

Shared knowledge base across all AI tools - what Claude learns, Gemini remembers.

### üíª VS Code-Like Interface

- Monaco code editor with multi-cursor editing
- TTYD-powered terminal with multiple sessions
- Visual Git control with staging and branch management
